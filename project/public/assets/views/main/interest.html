                <p class="interest-description">
                  I have been playing softball since I was a kid, and it has 
                  been a constant source of passion, discipline, and growth 
                  in my life. Today, I am proud to play collegiate softball at 
                  Fordham University, where I compete as a catcher. The game has 
                  shaped who I am—on and off the field—teaching me the value of 
                  teamwork, resilience, and leadership.

                <p class="interest-description">
                  Live music is one of my absolute favorite things—I have been to 
                  over 30 concerts and counting! My very first show was a Bob Marley 
                  cover band, and I’ve been hooked on the energy of live performances 
                  ever since. From small venues to packed crowds, there is something 
                  electric about being surrounded by people who all love the same 
                  music. I listen to just about everything, but I am especially drawn 
                  to indie punk, pop, and rock. Some of the most unforgettable shows 
                  I have been to include Peter McPoland, Conan Gray, Declan McKenna, and 
                  most recently, Vundabar. Each concert is a memory I carry with me—and 
                  I am always looking forward to the next one.

              <h5 class="interest-title">Theatre and Musicals</h5>
              <p class="interest-description">
                There’s something magical about live theatre that never fails to captivate me. 
                I’m completely obsessed with musicals—the storytelling, the music, the emotion—
                it all pulls me in. I’ve seen my favorite show, Hadestown, four times and could
                 honestly go four more! I’ve been lucky enough to see incredible productions on
                  Broadway like Cabaret, Sweeney Todd, The Great Gatsby, and Chicago, as well 
                  as touring performances of Hamilton and Mean Girls. Beyond just enjoying the 
                  shows, I love digging into the storytelling—analyzing the lyrics, themes, and
                   characters long after the curtain closes. Some of my favorite performers are 
                   Eva Noblezada and Jeremy Jordan; their voices and stage presence are absolutely 
                   unforgettable. Theatre will always have my heart (and a spot in my calendar 
                   for the next show).

              <h5 class="interest-title">Reading</h5>
              <p class="interest-description">
                Reading has always been a huge part of my life—there’s nothing like getting 
                lost in a good story. I’m especially drawn to fantasy and dystopian novels 
                that let me escape into new worlds and explore big ideas through imaginative 
                storytelling. I’m currently building my own personal library, which has grown 
                to over 100 books (and counting!). One of my most prized finds is a book from 
                1929, which sits proudly on my shelf. Right now, I’m making my way through the
                 Harry Potter series, with plans to reread The Hunger Games next—especially 
                 with Sunrise on the Reaping recently coming out. After that, I’m diving headfirst 
                 into the sprawling world of Sarah J. Maas. My TBR list is never-ending, and I 
                 wouldn't have it any other way.

              <p class="interest-description">
                Baking has always been one of my favorite creative outlets—there’s 
                something so rewarding about turning simple ingredients into something 
                delicious. I’ve experimented with everything from cakes and breads to more 
                intricate pastries, but my specialty is Oreo cupcakes. In high school, I 
                even competed in a Cupcake Wars fundraiser where I baked and sold over 500 
                cupcakes! Whether I’m testing a new recipe or making a batch of my go-to 
                treats for friends and family, baking is a sweet way for me to relax, share 
                joy, and get a little messy in the kitchen.
